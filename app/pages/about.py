    # **Welcome to Vol Surfer!**

    This app is designed to be a fun and interactive tool for researching how **implied volatility surfaces** impact an options portfolioâ€™s **payoff and Greeks**.

    ### **How to Use the App**
    - **Model Setup**: Input the **DTEs** (Days to Expiration) you want to model, along with the **underlying price** and **strike width**.
    - **Assumptions**: The model assumes **zero dividends**.
    - **Simulation Parameters**: You can customize the **elapsed time, number of timesteps, underlying range, and risk-free rate** in the simulation settings dropdown.
    - **Volatility Surface Parameters**: 
      - Specify at least one set of volatility surface parameters.
      - The **ATM Vols** entry should be a comma-separated list of values corresponding to the number of expirations being modeled.
      - **Important:** Volatility values should be in decimal form (e.g., `0.45`, not `45`).
      - The **skew parameter** affects the "tilt" of the surface. A **negative skew** means that implied volatility is higher for OTM puts than for OTM calls (which is typically seen in equities).
      - The **kurtosis parameter** (or **"smile"**) influences the wings of the surface by increasing implied volatility for options further from the underlying.

    ### **Volatility Surface Formula**
    The exact formula used to compute the implied volatility is:

    $$
    \sigma_{atm} + s(m - 1) + k(m - 1)^2
    $$

    where:

    - $$m = \\frac{K}{S}$$ (strike over stock price) is the **moneyness** of the option,
    - $$s$$ is the **skew parameter**, and
    - $$k$$ is the **kurtosis parameter**.

    ### **Option Chain**
    The Option Chain page constructs an option chain for you to build a hypothetical portfolio. 
    Simply select the options to include in your portfolio, scroll down to the "Selected Options" 
    level to input the amount of contracts to add to your portfolio. 

    ### **Payoff and Greeks**
    Once on the Payoff and Greeks page, you can
